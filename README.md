Task 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Task 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Task 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Task 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
